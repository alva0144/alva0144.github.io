            <h1>About me</h1>
        </header>
          <p>My name is Maria Camila Alvarez and I am an Industrial and Graphic Designer</em> from <em>Bogot√°, Colombia</em>. I am 31 and I moved with my husband to Ottawa on November the 30<sup>th</sup> because I am taking an <abbr title= "Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> course at Algonquin College. I want to improve my current skills and learn new ones to obtain experience in the Canadian advertising industry.</p>

        <p>Some of my hobbies are riding my bike and going to concerts. That is why my husband and I got two tickets to go to a Bad Bunny concert next month in Montreal. I am really excited because it will be the first concert we attend since the pandemic started and we will have the opportunity to know a new city.</p>
